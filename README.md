# Encrypted_Chatroom

This is a secure chat application implemented in Python using socket programming. The application ensures secure communication between the client and server by encrypting messages using AES and IDEA encryption algorithms.

## Features

- Secure communication using AES and IDEA encryption algorithms.
- Public key cryptography for exchanging session keys securely.
- Hashing for verifying the integrity of public keys.

## Files

- `server.py`: Contains the code for the server-side implementation of the chat application.
- `client.py`: Contains the code for the client-side implementation of the chat application.

## Usage

1. Run `server.py` on the server machine.
2. Run `client.py` on the client machine.
3. Enter the server address and port number when prompted by the client.
4. Start sending and receiving encrypted messages securely.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
